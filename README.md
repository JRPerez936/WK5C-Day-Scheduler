# WK5C-Day-Scheduler

This is a website containing a work day scheduler. It has been designed after the mockup shown and contains multiple functions.
On the middle of the scheduler, you can see boxes coded to be colored based on the time of day. the recording was taken at a time 
that the schedule will register as the end of the day, and all the listings will show as the "future" color, but if done during one of
the listed hours, it will show colors representing "past" and "present" hours. there is a save button to the right of the text area, where
once clicked, the data will save information into localStorage and if the page is refreshed you can see that the text is returned to their
entry points.

Below is an example of what the website looks like: <br />
